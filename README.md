# Breast_Cancer_Detection
1. Introduction
Breast cancer is a major global health concern, and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. This project develops a Breast Cancer Detection System using machine learning to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on structured clinical data, eliminating the need for complex image processing.

2. Objectives
Develop an ML-based classification system for breast cancer.
Train models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest on clinical data.
Build a user-friendly web app for real-time predictions.
Ensure a deployable, accessible, and cost-effective solution.
3. Dataset & Features
Uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, containing 30 clinical features such as tumor size, texture, and smoothness.

4. Methodology
Data Processing â€“ Cleaning, normalizing, and preparing data.
Model Training â€“ Using Logistic Regression (for interpretability) and Random Forest (for higher accuracy).
Web Application â€“ Built with Streamlit, allowing users to input clinical data and get instant predictions.
Deployment â€“ Hosted on Streamlit Cloud, Render, or Heroku for easy access.
5. Key Features
âœ… No Image Processing Required â€“ Works with structured clinical data.
âœ… Simple & Effective â€“ Ideal for students and small-scale research.
âœ… Instant Diagnosis â€“ Real-time classification of tumors.
âœ… Web-Based & Deployable â€“ Accessible from any device.

6. Applications
Educational Tool â€“ Helps students learn ML applications in healthcare.
Decision Support â€“ Provides quick preliminary breast cancer assessments.
Cost-Effective Solution â€“ No need for expensive imaging techniques.
This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in healthcare, offering an easy-to-use, impactful solution for early breast cancer detection. ðŸš€
